    - Displays a list of cart items with details like food name, quantity, and price.
    - Allows users to update the quantity or remove items from the cart.
- **Firebase Integration**:
    - Cart data is stored in **Firebase Firestore**, and changes are synced in real-time.

### 5. **Profile Screen**
- **Purpose**: Displays the user's details and allows them to update their profile information such as name, email, and phone number.
- **Firebase Integration**:
    - Syncs profile data with **Firebase Authentication** and **Firestore**.

### 6. **Settings Screen**
- **Purpose**: Allows users to configure app settings, such as notification preferences, theme, and language.

### 7. **Navigation Drawer**
- **Purpose**: Provides easy navigation to various sections of the app, such as Profile, Settings, Cart, Orders, and Logout.

### 8. **Bottom Navigation**
- **Purpose**: Quick navigation between the main areas of the app. The bottom navigation includes:
    - Home

### 9. **Payment Screen**
- **Purpose**: Allows users to manage payment methods and complete the payment process for their orders.

### 10. **Edit Profile Screen**
- **Purpose**: Allows users to edit their personal information, such as phone number or address.

### 11. **Set Location Screen**
- **Purpose**: Users can set or update their delivery location to ensure the restaurant can deliver the food.

### 12. **Delivery and Dining Fragments**
- **Purpose**: Separate fragments for:
    - **Delivery**: Users can opt for food delivery.
    - **Dining In**: Users can opt to dine in at the restaurant.
- These fragments interact with **Firebase Firestore** to manage the user’s order status and preferences.

## RecyclerViews Used in the App

- **Cart RecyclerView**:
    - Displays the items in the user's cart.
    - Supports item removal and quantity adjustment.
    - Integrated with **Firebase** to fetch and update cart data in real-time.

- **Restaurant List RecyclerView**:
    - Displays the list of restaurants on the Home screen.
    - Supports searching, sorting, and filtering using **Firebase Firestore** queries.

- **Order List RecyclerView**:
    - Displays a list of the user’s past orders on the Orders screen.
    - Each order is retrieved from **Firebase Firestore** and displayed with its status.

## Firebase Integration

### Firebase Authentication
Firebase Authentication is used to authenticate users via Google or phone number login. The following methods are implemented:
- **Google Sign-In**: Users can sign in using their Google account.
- **Phone Number Authentication**: Users can authenticate using their phone number.

### Firebase Firestore
Firebase Firestore is used to store and manage the following data:
- **Users**: Stores user details such as name, email, phone number, and profile picture.
- **Restaurants**: Stores restaurant information including name, location, menu, and available dishes.
- **Cart**: Stores the user's cart items and their real-time updates.
- **Orders**: Stores orders placed by users, including details like the restaurant, food items, total cost, and order status.

### Firebase Real-Time Database
The Real-Time Database is used to sync the cart and order status in real-time across devices.

## Navigation Structure

### Bottom Navigation
- **Home**: Displays a list of restaurants and dishes, allows searching and filtering.
- **Cart**: Displays cart items and allows users to modify the cart.
- **Profile**: Displays user details and allows editing.
- **Settings**: Allows the user to manage app settings.

### Navigation Drawer
The drawer contains the following items:
- **Profile**: Access the Profile screen to view and edit user information.
- **Cart**: Quick access to the Cart screen.
- **Orders**: View past orders and track current orders.
- **Settings**: Access to app settings and preferences.
- **Logout**: Logs the user out and returns to the Login screen.

## Responsiveness
All screens have been designed to be responsive, ensuring that the app works seamlessly across various screen sizes and orientations. The use of **ConstraintLayout** and **ScrollViews** ensures that the layout adjusts to different devices.

## Technical Challenges Faced
- Initially, I struggled with Firebase setup and real-time data syncing. However, after thorough documentation review, I was able to integrate Firebase Authentication and Firestore seamlessly.
- Managing real-time updates with Firebase's real-time database presented some challenges with syncing cart and order statuses across multiple devices.

## Future Plans
- **Backend Enhancements**: Integrate additional Firebase features like Cloud Functions for more advanced features such as order notifications and push notifications.
- **Payment Integration**: Adding support for multiple payment methods, including credit/debit cards and mobile wallets.
- **User Feedback**: Implement a system for users to leave feedback on restaurants and food items.

## Conclusion
This README provides a detailed overview of the **Zomato-inspired** food delivery mobile application, its design, features, and integration with Firebase. The app is fully functional with a responsive UI, real-time cart updates, and Firebase-powered backend.

The project is now complete, and I will be pursuing further development on a personal basis for more advanced features such as enhanced user roles, AI-based food recommendations, and better payment gateway integration. Thank you for following this journey!
